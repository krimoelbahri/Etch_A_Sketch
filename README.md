# Etch_a_Sketch

version: '1.0.0'

this is My Second Project of The Odin project.

It's an adaptation of the very famous game "Etch a Sketch".

- I tried to make sure you can start/stop drawing by clicking.
- you can change the number of squares.
- It support both drawing with random colors & gray shading until it goes black.

I hope you like it, and if you have any feed backs about it i would appreciate it.
